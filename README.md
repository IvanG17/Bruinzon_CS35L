# Bruinzon_CS35L

I merged old frontend_matt branch into David's frontend branch, and then deleted the old frontend_matt branch and created this new one.

Updated frontend:
To properly run Bruinzon first cd into main bruinzon directory and do "node app". Then cd into the ecommerce directory and run "npm start"
